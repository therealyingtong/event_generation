# event_generation

library to simulate photon generation events from SPDC source on satellite 

## basic distribution
- Poissonian

## losses
- dead time of passively quenched detectors (1us)
- low resolution of time stamp device
- adjustable in a range from 0 to 40 dB

## distortions
- clock drift 165us/s leads to dynamic time bin shift
- Doppler shift
